# Genome Variant Refinement Pipeline (GVRP)

The Genome Variant Refinement Pipeline (GVRP) is a Python-based tool developed to refine Variant Call Format (VCF) files produced by DeepVariant.
In GVRP we separate in "analysis" and "pipeline" for usage. In analysis, we provide the source code that can reenact the results in paper. On the other hand, in pipeline, you can use the GVRP as the pipeline for refining the variants in VCF file.
It allows for the processing of VCF files by offering functionalities to input, output, and optionally delete variants from the VCF files.

## Requirements

Requirements are differ by the purpose of the user. For conduct the analysis on paper, use the requirements.txt in GVRP-analysis, for just using pipeline, then the requirements.txt in GVRP-pipeline is enough.
